# build-docker.sh - Build and publish Docker image for xTeVe Channel Alerts
#
# This script:
# 1. Builds a multi-architecture Docker image for xTeVe Channel Alerts (amd64 and arm64)
# 2. Tags it with the current Git commit hash and 'latest'
# 3. Provides an option to push the image to Docker Hub
#
# Usage: ./build-docker.sh [push]
#   - Run without arguments to build locally only
#   - Run with 'push' argument to build and push to Docker Hub

# Exit on any error
set -e

# Configuration - Change these variables to match your Docker Hub username
