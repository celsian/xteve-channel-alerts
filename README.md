# xteve-channel-alerts

### Why?
I sometimes sit down to watch a specific channel only to find it's missing from my xTeVe playlist. My xTeVe updates my playlist nightly, this app is designed to run nightly after the update to compare today's channel list to yesterday's.
If it detects any missing channels, it will send an alert to a Discord webhook with the list of missing channels.

### Setup
1. Copy the .env.example file to .env
2. Populate the .env with your values.
3. Run the app
